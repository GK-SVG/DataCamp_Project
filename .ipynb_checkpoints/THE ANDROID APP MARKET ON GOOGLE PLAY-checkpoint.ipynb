    "## 1. Google Play Store apps and reviews\n",
    "<p>Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this notebook, we will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.</p>\n",

    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><code>apps.csv</code>: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.</li>\n",
    "<li><code>user_reviews.csv</code>: contains 100 reviews for each app, <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/01/21/google-play-stores-redesigned-ratings-and-reviews-section-lets-you-easily-filter-by-star-rating/\">most helpful first</a>. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.</li>\n",

    "The four features that we will be working with most frequently henceforth are Installs, Size, Rating and Price. The info() function (from the previous task) told us that Installs and Price columns are of type object and not int64 or float64 as we would expect. This is because the column contains some characters more than just [0,9] digits. Ideally, we would want these columns to be numeric as their name suggests.\n",
    "Hence, we now proceed to data cleaning and prepare our data to be consumed in our analyis later. Specifically, the presence of special characters (, $ +) in the Installs and Price columns make their conversion to a numerical data type difficult."
